# challenge2: Portfolio

## Webpage description

I created this portfolio to be able to display my work in the future as well as have a good point of reference for any future employer to familiarize themselves with me and my work.

I had the most trouble with the flexboxes of the images in the work section. It looks pretty close to the mockup and it is usable with a max width of 768 pixels but I brute forced parts of it with manual changes. I couldn't get it to look how I wanted otherwise.

In the future when I have actual projects that I have completed I can't wait to replace the placeholder links/images with those.


## Features

1. Links at the top right should bring you down to the correlating sections in the body of the webpage. 
2. All contact links should bring you to my phone, email, and github.
3. At 768 pixel width and smaller it does switch to a more mobile friendly viewing experience.
